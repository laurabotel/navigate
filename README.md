A visual overview of Kubernetes clusters + network policies with aggregated live logs.
<h2></h2>
</p>



Before your cluster is running, upload your YAML config files to: 

  -  visualize the network structure of the cluster; see the connections between your stateful sets, deployments, daemonSets, services, and more.
  -  zoom in on the deployment nodes to see how containers and container images are deployed.
  -  visualize your network policies laid out in a simple manner, viewing one policy at a time.

While your cluster is running, you can see: 
  -  etcd/node scheduler decisions aggregated across many different logs
  -  live deployment data, including statuses and conditions
  -  live pod data that you would normally only get with `kubectl` commands
